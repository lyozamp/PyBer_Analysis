#PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Lastly, I created a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. The metrics and visualization created was then analyzed to provide recommendations to the CEO of Pyber to address any disparities among the city types.

## Results

From the above data we can see that Urban cities had the most amount of rides and drivers and rural cities had the least. As a result the city type Urban brings the most fares as we can see in the Total Fares column and rural cities bring the least amount of fares. However, as we analyze the Average Fare per Ride column of this dataframe we can see that Rural city types have the highest average fare per ride, meaning they had a higher chance of more profits in this city type for every ride compared to Urban city types wich has the lowest average fare per ride. Other metric that we can see in this dataframe is the average fare per driver, from this data it can be seen that drivers in the rural city type make $55.49 per ride, whereas the drivers in urban areas make almost 3 times less per ride which is $16.57.

In the above line chart we can visualize data for the Total Fares from January 1 2019 to April 29th 2019 for each of the city types. We can quickly oberve that Urban city types had the highest total fares for all the weeks and rural areas had the least. We can also observe that the 3rd week of February has the highest total fares for each of the city type showing increased demand at that time. Urban cities aslo seem to bring a lot of profits in the first and third week of March. Towards the start of January 2019 and towards the end of April all Fares for each city type are showling decline.

## Summary
Based on the results, I recommend the following to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

1.) Urban cities had the highest total fare and most amount of rides and therefore account for most profits for the company. Since this is the best performing city type, future investments should be continued to be made in this type to realize greater profits for PyBer in the future.

2.) Rural cities had the least amount of rides and the least amount of total fares among all the types, however average fare per ride is the highest for this city type. This city type had the least amount of drivers but average fare per driver is the highest for this city type, therefore if ridership can be increased through marketing, then it could be easier to get drivers and word out of this industry in this particular city type.

3.) The suburban city type was the middle performing city type in all the metrics calculated, therefore more investments can be directed towards Urban and Rural city types, as this city type can continue and perform as it is doing currently for PyBer.
